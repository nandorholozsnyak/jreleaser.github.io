= Binary

Distributions of this type provide a platform specific native binary, as a consequence you *must* specify a platform value
for each one of their artifacts.

Distributions of this type conform to the following file structure:

[source]
----
.
├── LICENSE
├── README
└── bin
    └── executable
----

== Creating a Distribution

You can use any tool/language at your disposal to create a distribution of this type as long as the file structure is
followed and the final artifact packaged as a Zip or Tar file. The archive must contain a root entry, typically
following the name of the archive, thus if the archive is named `app-1.2.3.zip` the root entry should be `app-1.2.3`.

Alternatively, you may also configure an xref:reference:assemble/archive.adoc[] assembler to create an archive.

== Packager Support

| xref:reference:packagers/spec.adoc[]       | {icon_req_y}
| xref:reference:packagers/winget.adoc[]     | {icon_req_y}
|===

NOTE: xref:reference:packagers/sdkman.adoc[] is only supported if the executable is originally Java based and has been
transformed using GraalVM Native Image.

== Universal Binaries

Binary distributions are expected to deliver platform specific binaries thus every artifact must have a value set for their
respective `platform` property. However, it's possible to skip validating this setting by defining an extra property named
`universal`, like it's shown in the following snippet:

[source,yaml]
----
distributions:
  app:
    type: BINARY
    artifacts:
      - path: target/distributions/{{distributionName}}/{{distributionName}}-{{projectVersion}}.zip
        extraProperties:
            universal: true
----

== GraalVM Native Image

Native image binaries can be created in many ways. Frameworks such as Micronaut, Quarkus, and Helidon provide Maven and
Gradle plugins that can create such binaries. The distribution should be packages as a Zip or Tar. The archive must
contain a root entry, typically following the name of the archive, thus if the archive is named `app-1.2.3.zip` the root
entry should be `app-1.2.3`.

NOTE: You must an extra property named `graalVMNativeImage` to the distribution.

Alternatively, you may also configure a xref:reference:assemble/native-image.adoc[] assembler.
